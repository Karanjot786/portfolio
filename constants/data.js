      `I've been developing full-stack application since I was 17 years old. I didn't know what full-stack meant at that time because the term was not coined back then.`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew bootstrap, you were cool.`,
      `But now, I'm a legend. I've been coding in Python, Django, Flask, React, Next JS, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, C++, PHP and YouDontKnowShit programming language etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.`,
